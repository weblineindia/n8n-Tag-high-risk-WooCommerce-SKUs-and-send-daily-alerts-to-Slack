# (Retail) Auto-Tag High-Risk SKUs

This workflow automatically monitors product sales in your WooCommerce store, detects fast-selling items, applies risk tags and sends a clear alert to Slack—so you never miss products that need attention.

This workflow checks your WooCommerce store every day, reviews product sales from the last 14 days and calculates how fast each product is selling. Based on sales volume, it assigns a risk level (OK, Watchlist, High-Risk or Critical), updates product tags in WooCommerce and sends a single, easy-to-read Slack alert for products that need attention.

You receive:

- **Daily automated sales analysis**
- **Automatic risk tagging inside WooCommerce**
- **One clean Slack alert with product name, units sold and risk level**

Ideal for store owners and operations teams who want proactive inventory control without manual reports.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1. Connect your **WooCommerce API credentials**.
2. Connect your **Slack workspace** and choose an alert channel.
3. Adjust sales thresholds if needed (optional).
4. Activate the workflow — daily monitoring starts automatically.

## What It Does

This workflow automates inventory risk detection:

1. Runs automatically on a daily schedule.
2. Fetches completed WooCommerce orders from the last 14 days.
3. Fetches product details from WooCommerce.
4. Counts how many units of each product were sold.
5. Assigns a risk level:
   - OK
   - Watchlist
   - High-Risk
   - Critical
6. Updates product tags in WooCommerce based on risk.
7. Combines all risky products into one list.
8. Sends a single Slack alert summarizing:
   - Product name
   - Units sold
   - Risk level

This prevents stock issues and highlights fast-selling products early.

## Who’s It For

This workflow is ideal for:

- WooCommerce store owners
- E-commerce operations teams
- Inventory & supply chain managers

- Businesses managing limited or high-demand stock
